# Pivot-Chart
# 🚴‍♂️ My First Attempt at Creating a Pivot Table and Chart in Excel with `Bike Sales.xlsx`

👋 Welcome to my project! In this exercise, I explored the capabilities of Microsoft Excel by working with the `Bike Sales.xlsx` dataset. I focused on data cleaning, manipulation, and visualisation by creating a pivot table and chart, and adding a slicer for interactivity.

## 📂 Dataset Overview

The `Bike Sales.xlsx` dataset contains sales data related to bicycles, including various attributes that provide insights into sales performance. The key attributes are:

- **Order ID**: Unique identifier for each order.
- **Customer Name**: Name of the customer who made the purchase.
- **Product**: The type of bike sold.
- **Quantity**: Number of bikes sold.
- **Sales Amount**: Total sales value for each order.
- **Region**: Geographic area of the sale.

## 🛠️ Tasks Performed

### 🔧 Data Cleaning
To ensure the dataset was reliable for analysis, I took the following steps:

1. **Removed Duplicates**: Cleaned up the data by eliminating any duplicate entries.
2. **Fixed Inconsistencies**: Standardised entries, such as product names and regions, to avoid discrepancies.

### 🔀 Data Manipulation
After cleaning the data, I performed various manipulations:

1. **Created a Pivot Table**: Summarised the sales data to analyze total sales by product and region.
   
2. **Calculated Totals**: Added calculated fields to show total sales and quantities sold for better insights.

### 📊 Data Visualisation
Once the pivot table was set up, I created a visual representation:

1. **Generated a Chart**: Created a bar chart from the pivot table to visually represent sales by product.
   

2. **Added a Slicer**: Incorporated a slicer to filter data dynamically by region, allowing for a more interactive analysis.


## 🔍 Insights Gained

From this project, I uncovered valuable insights:

1. **Sales Trends**: Identified which bike models are the top sellers in each region.
2. **Regional Performance**: Analyzed sales performance across different geographic regions to pinpoint areas for growth.
